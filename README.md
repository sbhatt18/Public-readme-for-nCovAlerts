# Public-readme-for-nCovAlerts
## nCovAlerts
nCovAlerts is a Coronavirus(COVID19) Discord bot that tracks cases of Coronavirus in the U.S and many other countries.

## Motivation

Due to all the confusion surrounding Covid 19, I wanted to help the community by creating an accurate Coronavirus bot. This bot uses an API called novelCovid and disease.sh to fetch data when a command is entered. Also, I tried to make it as relevent as possible so discord users can stay up-to date during the pandemic.

## Installation

Invite the bot to your server and start using it.
To test the bot, 

1. Create a discord account (if you dont have one) & login: https://discord.com/register

2. Navigate to https://discord.com/app and click (+) button to create a server

3. Invite the bot using the link  https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=758787603549257761&scope=bot&permissions=8 and choose the server you just created,

4. Use the !help command to show all commands
